            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8">I am Jane Aarthy, and I am a Software Engineer. I'm doing a two-year
                Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College. I earned my bachelor's degree from Sri
                Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), with a CGPA of 3.62. I have published a
                research paper at the IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation for
                Sustainability in 2016.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8">I have four years of industrial experience in the field of Information
                Technology. Even though my work experience has developed my professional and technical skills, I
                realized that it is essential to stay current in this rapidly evolving industry by acquiring new
                knowledge. Therefore, continuous learning has always been one of my priorities, and studying in
                Canada will be a milestone towards fulfilling my academic and career goals.</p>
